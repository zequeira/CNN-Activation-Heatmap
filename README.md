# CNN Activation Heatmap for Image Classification using TensorFlow

Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are powerful algorithms for computer vision tasks. Often, artificial neural networks are seen as a black box that makes it difficult to understand why certain predictions are made. Moreover, "Explainable AI" is a challenging field of research that has received a lot of attention in recent years.

This repository features a Jupyter notebook for visualizing what a CNN values when making predictions in an image classification task.
